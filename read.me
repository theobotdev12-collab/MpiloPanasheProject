# Zimbabwe Local Food Image Dataset for CNN Models

## Overview
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for image-based tasks. They typically consist of an input image layer, convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

This dataset was created to support the development of a **Zimbabwean local food classification model**, with a specific focus on **kidney health awareness and nutrition analysis**.

The dataset contains images of common **local and widely consumed foods in Zimbabwe**, curated for training, validation, and testing of CNN-based image classification models.

This structure is compatible with popular deep learning frameworks such as **TensorFlow/Keras** and **PyTorch**.

---

## Data Collection
All images in this dataset were **scraped and curated by the author** from publicly accessible sources, including **ZIMSTAT-related online resources**, for an academic and experimental research project.

The dataset was compiled by combining multiple local food image sources, followed by cleaning, relabeling, and splitting into training, validation, and testing sets.

## Motivation and Inspiration
The primary motivation behind this dataset is to support the development of **Mpilo**, a kidney health management application designed for local communities.

Planned features include:

- 📸 Image-based food recognition using CNNs  
- 🩺 Automatic indication of whether a food is kidney-friendly  
- 🧂 Display of estimated nutrient levels:
  - Potassium
  - Phosphorus
  - Sodium  
- 📚 An education hub for kidney health and nutrition awareness  
- 🛒 A marketplace for selling organic and kidney-friendly crops  

The long-term goal is to empower users to make informed dietary choices using **AI-driven, culturally relevant food recognition**.

---

## Use Cases
- Food image classification
- Nutrition-aware health applications
- Kidney disease dietary guidance
- Educational AI tools
- Zimbabwe-focused AI research
